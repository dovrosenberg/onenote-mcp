```

A test file is named for the source file it covers: `test/config.test.ts` covers
`src/config.ts`. Not every source file has one. `src/index.ts` is a top-level entrypoint
whose behaviour is process exit codes and stderr, so it has no unit test; check it by
running it. Unsetting a required variable and running `npm start` must print the list of
missing names and exit 1 with no line matching `at …(`, and binding a port already in
use must print one readable line rather than an `EADDRINUSE` stack. `src/bootstrap.ts`
is a placeholder until issue #9.

`test/graph-auth.test.ts` drives `acquireGraphToken` through a hand-written
`SilentTokenSource` and never constructs a `PublicClientApplication`, so
`createGraphAuth` has no automated test. Testing it needs a cache seeded by a real
device-code sign-in, which arrives with issues #9 and #10, and no credential that could
seed one may be committed. Nothing verifies it until an operator runs it by hand against
the real app registration.

`test/token-cache.test.ts` covers `readCache` and nothing else. `readCache` is a pure
function over a document snapshot, so it runs without a backend. `beforeCacheAccess`,
`afterCacheAccess`, the transaction inside `afterCacheAccess`, and
`createFirestoreTokenCachePlugin` have no automated test at all. They need a Firestore
backend, and the emulator is not installed here. Installing it takes `sudo apt-get
install google-cloud-cli-firestore-emulator`, because this machine's `gcloud` is the
Debian package and its component manager is disabled, so `gcloud components install
cloud-firestore-emulator` is refused. Nothing stands in for those tests; the gap is
open, and closing it means an operator driving the plugin against an emulator by hand.
Do not close it by adding an in-memory Firestore fake: the behaviour at stake is transaction retry under contention
and `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()`, and a fake would assert the fake's behaviour rather
than Firestore's.

`scripts/test/` is deliberately separate from `test/`: those are bash tests driven by
`scripts/test/run.sh`. `npm test` does not run them. `bootstrap.test.sh` exercises
`gcp-bootstrap.sh` against a stub `gcloud` on `PATH`. `docker.test.sh` builds the image
and starts the container, so it needs a Docker daemon and takes about a minute;
`run.sh` runs it only when `RUN_DOCKER_TESTS=1` is set and prints an explicit skip line
otherwise. Both suites still get `bash -n` and `shellcheck` on every run.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm ci` | Install from the lockfile |
| `npm run build` | `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` → `dist/` |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc -p tsconfig.json` — covers `src/` **and** `test/`, emits nothing |
| `npm test` | `node --test "test/**/*.test.ts"` — runs TypeScript source directly, no build needed |
| `npm run dev` | `node --watch src/index.ts` |
| `npm start` | `node dist/index.js` — run `npm run build` first |
| `npm run bootstrap` | `node src/bootstrap.ts` |

There is no ESLint. `npm run typecheck` is the static-analysis gate; run it before every
commit. It catches the class of error a linter would here.

## Conventions

**Import specifiers carry the `.ts` extension.** Write `import { loadConfig } from
'./config.ts'`, not `'./config.js'`. `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` turns it into
`.js` on emit, so the same source both runs under `node --test` without a build and
compiles to working output in `dist/`. Test files reach into source as
`'../src/config.ts'`.

**The source must be erasable.** `npm test` relies on Node's native type stripping,
which removes types but cannot transform syntax. So: no `enum`, no `namespace`, no
constructor parameter properties, and type-only imports written `import type`.
`erasableSyntaxOnly` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` enforce this at typecheck time — you
will get `TS1294` rather than a confusing runtime failure.

**Two tsconfigs, on purpose.** `tsconfig.json` is the broad one: it includes `test/`, so
the editor and `npm run typecheck` check test files, and it sets `noEmit` so it cannot
produce output by accident. `tsconfig.build.json` narrows to `src/` and emits. Keeping
them split is what stops compiled tests landing in `dist/` and then in the container
image built by issue #6.

**Configuration is grouped, and read in exactly one place.** `loadConfig(groups, env)`
in `src/config.ts` validates only the groups the caller asks for: `graph`, `firestore`,
`oauth`, `server`. The server asks for all four; `bootstrap.ts` asks for `graph` and
`firestore` only, so the operator running it locally is never made to hold
`MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`. Add a new variable to the `SPECS` table, not to a new
`process.env` read somewhere else.

**Startup failures print one readable message and exit 1 — never a stack trace.** That
covers missing variables, malformed values, and bind failures (`EADDRINUSE`, `EACCES`).
`loadConfig` accumulates every problem before throwing, so one run reports the full list.
`exitOnConfigError` is the only place in `src/config.ts` allowed to call `process.exit`,
and only entrypoints call it.

**Never hardcode a port.** Cloud Run sets `PORT`. The only literal `8080` in `src/` is
the documented default in the `SPECS` table in `config.ts`.

**`createApp()` does not listen.** Construction is separate from binding so tests can
drive routes on an ephemeral port. Mount new routes there, not in `index.ts`.

**`/healthz` reports no configuration.** The service deploys `--allow-unauthenticated`,
so its response body is public. A test asserts no key or value in that body matches the
stub config's secrets; do not add config echo to it.

**The container's runtime base is Debian `-slim`, never Alpine.**
`@resvg/resvg-js-linux-x64-gnu` declares `libc: ["glibc"]` and ships no musl prebuild.
On an Alpine base the optional package either fails to install or fails at `require`
time, and handwriting rendering is the point of this service.

**The runtime stage installs its own dependencies; it does not copy `node_modules`
forward.** `npm ci --omit=dev` runs again from the lockfile in the runtime stage. Copying
`/app/node_modules` from the build stage would ship `typescript` and `@types/node` into
the deployed image, and it would test nothing about whether the platform-specific resvg
package still resolves without dev dependencies. `scripts/test/docker.test.sh` asserts
both — that the `.node` binary is present and that `node_modules/typescript` is not.

**`.dockerignore` is a denylist.** A new source directory is included in the build
context by default rather than silently dropped. The entries that mirror `.gitignore`
(`.env*`, `*.token-cache.json`, `.msal-cache*`) are there so a local operator's
credentials cannot reach an image layer.

**The server never signs in interactively.** `acquireTokenByDeviceCode` belongs to
`src/bootstrap.ts` alone. The deployed service acquires silently from the Firestore
cache through `src/graph-auth.ts`. A device-code call in a request path would block on a
human who is not there, and Cloud Run would time the request out. A test in
`test/graph-auth.test.ts` scans every file under `src/` for that call.

**Graph auth failures are `GraphAuthError`, never a raw MSAL error.**
`acquireGraphToken` wraps both the `getTokenCache().getAllAccounts()` call and the
`acquireTokenSilent` call, so an undecodable cache, an empty cache, and a dead refresh
token all reach the caller as one error type whose message ends in `npm run bootstrap`.
Letting the MSAL error through instead surfaces to the operator as a bare 401 from
Graph, which does not say that a human has to re-run the CLI. The messages name the
document path and the underlying error, never `username` or `homeAccountId` — the first
is the user's UPN and the second embeds the tenant id.

**The token cache is one opaque string in one document.** `FirestoreTokenCachePlugin`
stores the output of MSAL's `serialize()` verbatim in the document's `cache` field,
alongside an `updatedAt` server timestamp. Do not parse that blob and do not split it
across documents. MSAL owns its structure and changes it between library versions.

**`afterCacheAccess` re-reads inside the transaction.** `--max-instances=1` does not
prevent two instances existing during a revision transition. The transaction re-reads the
document, and a stored blob differing from the one this instance last saw is fed back
through `context.tokenCache.deserialize` before `serialize()` is called, because MSAL's
`deserialize` merges into the in-memory cache rather than replacing it. Removing the
re-read turns an overlap into a lost refresh token, and the cache stays unusable until
`npm run bootstrap` is run again.

## Repository hygiene

This repository is public, and so are its issues, pull requests, and Actions logs.

Never commit, and never put in an issue or a workflow log: real page content, rendered
ink images, the Entra tenant name or ID, Firestore document contents, or the Layer-1
OAuth client secret. `.gitignore` covers `output/`, `.env*`, `*.token-cache.json`, and
`.msal-cache*`. Example output in `README.md` must come from a throwaway page with fake content.
The Azure client ID is *not* secret in this design (public client, device-code flow) and
is safe in config examples.

## Workflow

Issues are labelled by phase (`phase-1-skeleton` … `phase-5-deploy`) and by who does them
(`claude` or `manual`). Work a `claude` issue directly; no separate plan document is
written. The issue's own task list and acceptance section are the specification, and the
commit message is where the reasoning goes — what the
implementation revealed that the issue did not anticipate belongs there, not in a
separate document.

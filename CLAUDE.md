```

A test file is named for the source file it covers: `test/config.test.ts` covers
`src/config.ts`. Not every source file has one. `src/index.ts` is a top-level entrypoint
whose behaviour is process exit codes and stderr, so it has no unit test; check it by
running it. Unsetting a required variable and running `npm start` must print the list of
missing names and exit 1 with no line matching `at …(`, and binding a port already in
use must print one readable line rather than an `EADDRINUSE` stack.

`test/bootstrap.test.ts` spawns `src/bootstrap.ts` as a child process, because the module
signs in at import time and exports nothing. It covers only what happens before the CLI
needs a human: the exit code and the message on an incomplete environment. The
device-code sign-in, the cache write, and the Graph probe have no automated test and
cannot get one — they need a browser, the real Entra tenant, and Firestore, and no
credential that could stand in for one may be committed. Verify them by running the CLI.

`test/graph-auth.test.ts` drives `acquireGraphToken` through a hand-written
`SilentTokenSource` and never constructs a `PublicClientApplication`, so
`createGraphAuth` has no automated test. Testing it needs a cache seeded by a real
device-code sign-in, and no credential that could seed one may be committed. Nothing
verifies it until an operator runs `npm run bootstrap` and then the server against the
same document.

`test/token-cache.test.ts` covers `readCache` and nothing else. `readCache` is a pure
function over a document snapshot, so it runs without a backend. `beforeCacheAccess`,
`afterCacheAccess`, the transaction inside `afterCacheAccess`, and
`createFirestoreTokenCachePlugin` have no automated test at all. They need a Firestore
backend, and the emulator is not installed here. Installing it takes `sudo apt-get
install google-cloud-cli-firestore-emulator`, because this machine's `gcloud` is the
Debian package and its component manager is disabled, so `gcloud components install
cloud-firestore-emulator` is refused. Nothing stands in for those tests; the gap is
open, and closing it means an operator driving the plugin against an emulator by hand.
Do not close it by adding an in-memory Firestore fake: the behaviour at stake is transaction retry under contention
and `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()`, and a fake would assert the fake's behaviour rather
than Firestore's.

`scripts/test/` is deliberately separate from `test/`: those are bash tests driven by
`scripts/test/run.sh`. `npm test` does not run them. `bootstrap.test.sh` exercises
`gcp-bootstrap.sh` against a stub `gcloud` on `PATH`. `docker.test.sh` builds the image
and starts the container, so it needs a Docker daemon and takes about a minute;
`run.sh` runs it only when `RUN_DOCKER_TESTS=1` is set and prints an explicit skip line
otherwise. Both suites still get `bash -n` and `shellcheck` on every run.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm ci` | Install from the lockfile |
| `npm run build` | `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` → `dist/` |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc -p tsconfig.json` — covers `src/` **and** `test/`, emits nothing |
| `npm test` | `node --test "test/**/*.test.ts"` — runs TypeScript source directly, no build needed |
| `npm run dev` | `node --watch src/index.ts` |
| `npm start` | `node dist/index.js` — run `npm run build` first |
| `npm run bootstrap` | `node src/bootstrap.ts` |

There is no ESLint. `npm run typecheck` is the static-analysis gate; run it before every
commit. It catches the class of error a linter would here.

## Conventions

**Import specifiers carry the `.ts` extension.** Write `import { loadConfig } from
'./config.ts'`, not `'./config.js'`. `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` turns it into
`.js` on emit, so the same source both runs under `node --test` without a build and
compiles to working output in `dist/`. Test files reach into source as
`'../src/config.ts'`.

**The source must be erasable.** `npm test` relies on Node's native type stripping,
which removes types but cannot transform syntax. So: no `enum`, no `namespace`, no
constructor parameter properties, and type-only imports written `import type`.
`erasableSyntaxOnly` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` enforce this at typecheck time — you
will get `TS1294` rather than a confusing runtime failure.

**Two tsconfigs, on purpose.** `tsconfig.json` is the broad one: it includes `test/`, so
the editor and `npm run typecheck` check test files, and it sets `noEmit` so it cannot
produce output by accident. `tsconfig.build.json` narrows to `src/` and emits. Keeping
them split is what stops compiled tests landing in `dist/` and then in the container
image built by issue #6.

**Configuration is grouped, and read in exactly one place.** `loadConfig(groups, env)`
in `src/config.ts` validates only the groups the caller asks for: `graph`, `firestore`,
`firestore-explicit`, `oauth`, `server`. The server asks for `graph`, `firestore`,
`oauth`, and `server`; `bootstrap.ts` asks for `graph` and `firestore-explicit` only, so
the operator running it locally is never made to hold `MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`. Add a
new variable to the `SPECS` table, not to a new `process.env` read somewhere else.

**The bootstrap CLI requires the two Firestore variables the server defaults.** That is
the whole difference between the `firestore` and `firestore-explicit` groups:
`FIRESTORE_CACHE_DOC` falls back to `tokencache/msal` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` may be
absent on Cloud Run, where the metadata server supplies it. The CLI runs against whatever
project the operator's Application Default Credentials point at, so letting either name
default would seed a real Firestore document somewhere the deployed service does not read
and still print a success line. Ask for one group or the other, never both.

**`ConfigError` is given the descriptions to print, not asked to look them up.** A
variable name appears in more than one group with a different reason for being required,
so `SPECS.find(byName)` would print the server's description in an error raised by the
bootstrap CLI. `loadConfig` collects the purposes of the specs it actually consulted and
passes that map to the constructor.

**Startup failures print one readable message and exit 1 — never a stack trace.** That
covers missing variables, malformed values, and bind failures (`EADDRINUSE`, `EACCES`).
`loadConfig` accumulates every problem before throwing, so one run reports the full list.
`exitOnConfigError` is the only place in `src/config.ts` allowed to call `process.exit`,
and only entrypoints call it.

**Never hardcode a port.** Cloud Run sets `PORT`. The only literal `8080` in `src/` is
the documented default in the `SPECS` table in `config.ts`.

**`createApp()` does not listen.** Construction is separate from binding so tests can
drive routes on an ephemeral port. Mount new routes there, not in `index.ts`.

**`/healthz` reports no configuration.** The service deploys `--allow-unauthenticated`,
so its response body is public. A test asserts no key or value in that body matches the
stub config's secrets; do not add config echo to it.

**The container's runtime base is Debian `-slim`, never Alpine.**
`@resvg/resvg-js-linux-x64-gnu` declares `libc: ["glibc"]` and ships no musl prebuild.
On an Alpine base the optional package either fails to install or fails at `require`
time, and handwriting rendering is the point of this service.

**The runtime stage installs its own dependencies; it does not copy `node_modules`
forward.** `npm ci --omit=dev` runs again from the lockfile in the runtime stage. Copying
`/app/node_modules` from the build stage would ship `typescript` and `@types/node` into
the deployed image, and it would test nothing about whether the platform-specific resvg
package still resolves without dev dependencies. `scripts/test/docker.test.sh` asserts
both — that the `.node` binary is present and that `node_modules/typescript` is not.

**`.dockerignore` is a denylist.** A new source directory is included in the build
context by default rather than silently dropped. The entries that mirror `.gitignore`
(`.env*`, `*.token-cache.json`, `.msal-cache*`) are there so a local operator's
credentials cannot reach an image layer.

**The bootstrap CLI shares the server's client id, authority, scopes, and cache
plugin.** It imports `GRAPH_SCOPES` from `src/graph-auth.ts` and
`createFirestoreTokenCachePlugin` from `src/token-cache.ts` rather than restating either.
MSAL keys cached tokens by client id and by scope string, so a short scope name in one
place and the fully-qualified form in the other produces a cache that looks valid and
that the server's silent acquisition misses. The CLI serializes nothing itself; the write
happens inside `acquireTokenByDeviceCode`, through the plugin's `afterCacheAccess`.

**The bootstrap CLI prints counts, not names, and one line about the tenant.** Its Graph
probe is `GET /me/onenote/notebooks?$select=id`, so notebook display names never enter
the response body. The confirmation names the Firestore project, the document path, and
the account's home tenant — the tenant because a device-code sign-in into the wrong
directory succeeds with no error, and that line is the only thing that catches it. The
CLI's own output therefore carries a tenant id and must not be pasted into an issue, a
pull request, or a workflow log; it says so itself.

**The server never signs in interactively.** `acquireTokenByDeviceCode` belongs to
`src/bootstrap.ts` alone. The deployed service acquires silently from the Firestore
cache through `src/graph-auth.ts`. A device-code call in a request path would block on a
human who is not there, and Cloud Run would time the request out. A test in
`test/graph-auth.test.ts` scans every file under `src/` for that call.

**Graph auth failures are `GraphAuthError`, never a raw MSAL error.**
`acquireGraphToken` wraps both the `getTokenCache().getAllAccounts()` call and the
`acquireTokenSilent` call, so an undecodable cache, an empty cache, and a dead refresh
token all reach the caller as one error type whose message ends in `npm run bootstrap`.
Letting the MSAL error through instead surfaces to the operator as a bare 401 from
Graph, which does not say that a human has to re-run the CLI. The messages name the
document path and the underlying error, never `username` or `homeAccountId` — the first
is the user's UPN and the second embeds the tenant id.

**The token cache is one opaque string in one document.** `FirestoreTokenCachePlugin`
stores the output of MSAL's `serialize()` verbatim in the document's `cache` field,
alongside an `updatedAt` server timestamp. Do not parse that blob and do not split it
across documents. MSAL owns its structure and changes it between library versions.

**`afterCacheAccess` re-reads inside the transaction.** `--max-instances=1` does not
prevent two instances existing during a revision transition. The transaction re-reads the
document, and a stored blob differing from the one this instance last saw is fed back
through `context.tokenCache.deserialize` before `serialize()` is called, because MSAL's
`deserialize` merges into the in-memory cache rather than replacing it. Removing the
re-read turns an overlap into a lost refresh token, and the cache stays unusable until
`npm run bootstrap` is run again.

## Repository hygiene

This repository is public, and so are its issues, pull requests, and Actions logs.

Never commit, and never put in an issue or a workflow log: real page content, rendered
ink images, the Entra tenant name or ID, Firestore document contents, or the Layer-1
OAuth client secret. `.gitignore` covers `output/`, `.env*`, `*.token-cache.json`, and
`.msal-cache*`. Example output in `README.md` must come from a throwaway page with fake content.
The Azure client ID is *not* secret in this design (public client, device-code flow) and
is safe in config examples.

## Workflow

Issues are labelled by phase (`phase-1-skeleton` … `phase-5-deploy`) and by who does them
(`claude` or `manual`). Work a `claude` issue directly; no separate plan document is
written. The issue's own task list and acceptance section are the specification, and the
commit message is where the reasoning goes — what the
implementation revealed that the issue did not anticipate belongs there, not in a
separate document.
